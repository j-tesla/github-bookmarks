# Contributing to GitHub Bookmarks
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
<!-- - Becoming a maintainer -->

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
<!-- 2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. -->
2. If required, update the documentation.
<!-- 4. Ensure the test suite passes. -->
<!-- 5. Make sure your code lints. -->
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/j-tesla/github-bookmarks/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/j-tesla/github-bookmarks/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
<!-- I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md) -->

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
<!-- * You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification -->
